# Feature Specification: Linktree-Style Landing Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-linktree-landing-page`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a small linktree landing page for https://onlineheldinnen.de. It should resemble this page https://www.klickreich.de/linkpage but with the styling and CI of the onlineheldinnen page. We don't need a database and no authentication. We use next.js with shadcn ui and tailwindcss. The goal is to have the page as a link in the bio of an instagram page and have all relevant links on it."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Instagram User Navigates to Link Page (Priority: P1)

An Instagram follower clicks the link in the onlineheldinnen bio and views a branded landing page with all available links organized in a clean, accessible format.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without this, the feature has no value. This represents the entire user journey from Instagram to the destination links.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the page URL directly and verifying all links are visible, clickable, and styled according to onlineheldinnen branding. Delivers immediate value as a functional link-in-bio page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user clicks the Instagram bio link, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a branded header with the onlineheldinnen logo and visual identity
2. **Given** the page has loaded, **When** the user scrolls, **Then** they see all available links organized in a clear, vertical list format
3. **Given** the user views a link card, **When** they click it, **Then** they are directed to the intended destination in a new tab
4. **Given** the user is on a mobile device, **When** the page loads, **Then** the layout adapts responsively with touch-friendly link buttons

### User Story 2 - Quick Access to Specific Resources (Priority: P2)

A user quickly identifies and accesses specific content types (social media, website, resources) through visual organization and clear labeling.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability but the page functions without categorization. Improves user experience by reducing cognitive load.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by presenting the page to users and timing how quickly they can locate specific link types. Delivers value through improved navigation efficiency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple links are displayed, **When** the user scans the page, **Then** links are visually distinguishable through icons, labels, or grouping
2. **Given** a user is looking for social media, **When** they scan the links, **Then** social media links are easily identifiable through icons or section headers
3. **Given** the page contains many links, **When** the user views the page, **Then** the most important links are prioritized at the top

---

### User Story 3 - Consistent Brand Experience (Priority: P1)

A visitor experiences consistent visual branding between the main onlineheldinnen website and the link page, reinforcing brand identity.

**Why this priority**: Brand consistency is critical for trust and recognition, especially when directing users from social media. Without this, the page could appear untrustworthy or unrelated.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by visual comparison with the main onlineheldinnen.de website, verifying colors, typography, and design elements match. Delivers value through brand reinforcement.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has visited onlineheldinnen.de, **When** they view the link page, **Then** they recognize the same color palette (purple #6369d1, gold #8e6704, pink #e01e5a)
2. **Given** the page loads, **When** the user views text elements, **Then** typography uses Mulish for headers and Montserrat for body text
3. **Given** the user views the page, **When** they see interactive elements, **Then** buttons and links use the onlineheldinnen color scheme and rounded design style
