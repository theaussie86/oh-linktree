# Specification Quality Checklist: Linktree-Style Landing Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification maintains a clear separation between user needs and implementation. While Next.js, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS were mentioned in the user input, they are appropriately documented in the Dependencies section without leaking into requirements. The spec focuses on what the page must do (display links, use brand colors, be responsive) rather than how it's built.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are testable and specific. For example:
- FR-007 specifies exact color codes (#6369d1, #8e6704, #e01e5a, #f2f3fa)
- FR-006 includes measurable performance target (under 2 seconds on 3G)
- FR-004 clearly states links must open in new tabs
- No ambiguous requirements remain

### Success Criteria Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-002: "Page loads in under 2 seconds on mobile 3G connections" (measurable time)
- SC-003: "Page displays correctly on all devices with screen widths from 320px to 1920px" (measurable range)
- SC-006: "Page achieves Lighthouse performance score of 90+ on mobile" (quantitative metric)
- SC-007: "Page is fully navigable using only keyboard" (verifiable behavior)

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification provides complete context for planning:
- Three prioritized user stories (P1, P2) with clear independent test criteria
- 12 functional requirements covering all aspects
- Clear scope boundaries (what's in/out)
- Documented assumptions about link management and hosting
- Dependencies clearly listed

## Notes

The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`). No clarifications are needed as:

1. All user requirements from the input are captured
2. The static nature (no database/auth) is clearly specified
3. Brand identity details are well-documented
4. The Instagram use case is central to all user stories
5. Reasonable defaults have been applied (e.g., 5-15 links assumption, standard web fonts)

The spec successfully avoids implementation details while providing enough specificity for planning. For example, it specifies brand colors and typography families without dictating how to implement them technically.
