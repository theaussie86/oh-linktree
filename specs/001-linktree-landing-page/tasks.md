# Tasks: Linktree-Style Landing Page

**Feature**: 001-linktree-landing-page
**Branch**: `001-linktree-landing-page`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-linktree-landing-page/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the feature specification, so test tasks are omitted. Focus is on implementation and manual validation.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Next.js App Router structure: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `public/`
- All paths relative to repository root: `/Users/cweissteiner/Petra/oh-linktree/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and shadcn/ui component library setup

- [X] T001 Initialize shadcn/ui with CLI: run `npx shadcn@latest init --legacy-peer-deps` with settings (style: new-york, CSS variables: yes)
- [X] T002 Install required shadcn/ui components: run `npx shadcn@latest add button card avatar separator badge tooltip --legacy-peer-deps`
- [X] T003 [P] Configure brand colors in app/globals.css with onlineheldinnen color palette (#6369d1, #e01e5a, #8e6704, #f2f3fa)
- [X] T004 [P] Configure Google Fonts (Mulish, Montserrat) in app/layout.tsx using next/font/google

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core type definitions and data structures that all components depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 [P] Create TypeScript type definitions in lib/types.ts (LinkItem, LinkCategory enum, PageMetadata, HeaderConfig interfaces)
- [X] T006 [P] Create links configuration data file in lib/links-data.ts with sample onlineheldinnen links (main website, Instagram, etc.)
- [X] T007 Update app/layout.tsx with complete metadata configuration (Open Graph, Twitter Cards, locale de_DE)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Instagram User Navigates to Link Page (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Deliver functional landing page with branded header, clickable link cards, and responsive mobile-first layout

**Independent Test**: Access page at localhost:3000, verify header displays with branding, all links are visible and clickable, page is responsive on mobile (320px-1920px width), all links open correctly (external links in new tab)

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T008 [P] [US1] Create Header component in components/header.tsx with logo, heading, subheading using HeaderConfig
- [X] T009 [P] [US1] Create LinkCard component in components/link-card.tsx with title, description, icon, hover effects
- [X] T010 [US1] Implement main landing page in app/page.tsx integrating Header and LinkCard components with links data
- [X] T011 [US1] Add responsive layout styles to app/page.tsx (max-width container, vertical card stack, mobile padding)
- [X] T012 [US1] Implement link opening behavior in LinkCard component (external links in new tab with rel="noopener noreferrer")
- [X] T013 [US1] Add hover states and transitions to LinkCard component (translateY, shadow, background color)
- [X] T014 [US1] Ensure mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints in all components

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently. Page loads with branded header, all links clickable, mobile-responsive.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Quick Access to Specific Resources (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enhance usability through visual organization, clear icons, and logical link ordering

**Independent Test**: Present page to users and verify links are visually distinguishable through icons, categories are identifiable, most important links appear at top (sorted by priority)

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T015 [P] [US2] Integrate Lucide React icons in LinkCard component (map icon names to components: home, instagram, facebook, etc.)
- [X] T016 [US2] Implement priority-based sorting in lib/links-data.ts with getActiveLinks() helper function
- [ ] T017 [US2] Add optional category badges/visual indicators to LinkCard component using LinkCategory enum
- [X] T018 [US2] Enhance LinkCard layout with icon positioning (left-aligned icon, text content, visual hierarchy)
- [X] T019 [US2] Update links data in lib/links-data.ts with appropriate icons and priorities for all links

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work. Page has clear visual organization, icons for all links, sorted by importance.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Consistent Brand Experience (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Ensure visual consistency with main onlineheldinnen.de website through colors, typography, and design elements

**Independent Test**: Visual comparison with onlineheldinnen.de - verify color palette matches (#6369d1, #e01e5a, #8e6704, #f2f3fa), typography uses Mulish for headers and Montserrat for body, buttons/links use brand colors and rounded corners

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T020 [P] [US3] Apply brand purple (#6369d1) to primary interactive elements in LinkCard hover states
- [X] T021 [P] [US3] Apply brand typography to components (Mulish for headings in Header, Montserrat for body in LinkCard)
- [X] T022 [P] [US3] Set brand background color (#f2f3fa) for page in app/page.tsx
- [X] T023 [US3] Apply brand design patterns to cards (8px border-radius, shadow, padding 24px 34px per research findings)
- [X] T024 [US3] Ensure brand navy (#1d1f45) used for heading text and brand text color (#3d3d4e) for body
- [X] T025 [US3] Add brand-appropriate footer with copyright text styled with brand colors

**Checkpoint**: All P1 user stories complete. Page fully branded, matches onlineheldinnen.de visual identity.

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories, accessibility, and deployment readiness

- [X] T026 [P] Add logo asset to public/logo.svg (placeholder or actual onlineheldinnen logo)
- [X] T027 [P] Add Open Graph image to public/og-image.png (1200x630px with onlineheldinnen branding)
- [X] T028 [P] Implement accessibility features in LinkCard (keyboard navigation, focus states, ARIA labels for icons)
- [X] T029 [P] Implement accessibility features in Header (semantic HTML header tag, alt text for logo)
- [X] T030 [P] Add skip-to-content link for keyboard users in app/layout.tsx
- [X] T031 Verify semantic HTML structure (header, main, footer tags) across app/page.tsx
- [ ] T032 Test keyboard navigation (tab through all links, enter to activate) on full page
- [X] T033 Add getActiveLinks() filter logic in lib/links-data.ts to hide inactive links (isActive: false)
- [X] T034 Optimize page performance with next/image for logo in Header component
- [X] T035 Add loading="lazy" to non-critical images if any additional images added
- [X] T036 Run development server (`npm run dev`) and validate page on multiple screen sizes (320px, 768px, 1920px)
- [X] T037 Build production bundle (`npm run build`) and verify no errors
- [ ] T038 Test production build locally (`npm start`) and run manual smoke test
- [ ] T039 Validate against quickstart.md - confirm all setup steps work and page matches specification
- [ ] T040 Verify FR-006 performance target (page load <2 seconds on 3G - test with Chrome DevTools throttling)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3, 4, 5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 and US3 are both P1 priority - US1 should complete first (base functionality before branding polish)
  - US2 (P2) can start after US1 completes, or in parallel if developer capacity allows
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 and US3 (P1 stories) being complete minimum, ideally all stories

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories - CORE FUNCTIONALITY
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after US1 completes (depends on LinkCard component) - ENHANCEMENT
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after US1 completes (applies branding to existing components) - BRAND CONSISTENCY

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: Header and LinkCard components [P] parallel ‚Üí Main page integrates both ‚Üí Layout/responsive ‚Üí Behavior ‚Üí Testing
- **US2**: Icons, sorting, categories can largely be done in parallel [P] ‚Üí Integrate into LinkCard ‚Üí Update data
- **US3**: Color applications can be done in parallel [P] ‚Üí Typography ‚Üí Design patterns ‚Üí Footer

### Parallel Opportunities

- T003 and T004 (Phase 1) can run in parallel
- T005, T006, T007 (Phase 2) can run in parallel
- T008 and T009 (US1) can run in parallel - different components
- T015, T016, T017 (US2) can largely run in parallel
- T020, T021, T022 (US3) can run in parallel - different styling concerns
- T026, T027, T028, T029, T030 (Phase 6) can run in parallel - different files/concerns

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch Header and LinkCard components together (US1):
Task T008: "Create Header component in components/header.tsx"
Task T009: "Create LinkCard component in components/link-card.tsx"

# After components exist, continue with integration and behavior:
Task T010: "Implement main landing page in app/page.tsx"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3

```bash
# Launch all brand color applications together (US3):
Task T020: "Apply brand purple to LinkCard hover states"
Task T021: "Apply brand typography to components"
Task T022: "Set brand background color for page"

# Continue with design patterns and footer:
Task T023: "Apply brand design patterns to cards"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 3 - Both P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup ‚Üí shadcn/ui installed, fonts configured, colors defined
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational ‚Üí Types defined, data structure ready, metadata configured (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 ‚Üí Core functionality complete (header, links, responsive)
4. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 ‚Üí Brand consistency applied (MVP complete with P1 stories)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test P1 stories independently, verify spec compliance
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Basic functional page ‚úÖ
3. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Branded page matching onlineheldinnen.de ‚úÖ (MVP with both P1 stories)
4. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Enhanced UX with icons and organization ‚úÖ (Full feature)
5. Complete Phase 6: Polish ‚Üí Production-ready ‚úÖ

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product = User Story 1 + User Story 3 (both P1)**

This delivers:
- Functional landing page with all links (US1)
- Consistent branding with onlineheldinnen.de (US3)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clickable, accessible links
- Ready for Instagram bio link

User Story 2 (P2) can be added in a second iteration for enhanced UX.

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No tests included as not explicitly requested in spec
- Manual validation guided by acceptance scenarios in spec.md
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag for all npm operations due to React 19

---

## Format Validation

‚úÖ All tasks follow required format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
‚úÖ Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation
‚úÖ Setup phase has no story labels (infrastructure)
‚úÖ Foundational phase has no story labels (shared prerequisites)
‚úÖ User story phases have story labels ([US1], [US2], [US3])
‚úÖ Polish phase has no story labels (cross-cutting concerns)
‚úÖ File paths included in all implementation tasks
‚úÖ Parallel markers [P] added where tasks can run simultaneously
